# What is LLM?

* An LLM is a neural network design to understand, generate and respond to human like text.
* These models are deep neural networks trained on massive amount of text data, sometimes large portion of the entire publicly available text on internet
* Models like this often have tens or even hundreds of billions of parameters.
* LLMs utilizes an architecture called the transformers, which allows them to pay selective attention to different parts of the input when making predictions, making them especially adept at handling the nuances and complexities of human language.
* Since, LLMs are capable of generating text, LLMs are also often referred to as generative AI or Gen AI.
